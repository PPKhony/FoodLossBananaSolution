Problem:
Bananas, a perishable fruit, release ethylene gas as they ripen, accelerating the ripening process of surrounding bananas. This can lead to significant losses in large-scale storage facilities if not detected and addressed promptly.

Solution:
This project proposes an AI-powered image recognition system to detect ripening bananas in storage facilities. By using Amazon Web Services (AWS), the system can monitor banana batches and send alerts when ripening is detected.

How it works:

1. Image Capture: Cameras capture images of bananas.
2. Image Upload: Images are uploaded to Amazon S3.
3. AI Analysis: Amazon ECS, using a pre-trained model, analyzes the images to determine the ripeness level of each banana.
4. Data Storage: Results are stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
5. Alerting: If a banana is detected as ripe, an alert is sent via Amazon SNS.

Benefits:

Reduced Food Waste: Timely detection of ripe bananas prevents mass spoilage.
Improved Efficiency: Optimized inventory management and distribution.
Sustainable Agriculture: Contributes to SDG 2 by reducing food waste and promoting sustainable agriculture.
